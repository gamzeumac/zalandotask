write a function: function solution(a); that, given an array a of n integers, returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in a. for example, given a = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2], the function should return 5. given a = [1, 2, 3], the function should return 4. given a = [−1, −3], the function should return 1. write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions: n is an integer within the range [1..100,000]; each element of array a is an integer within the range [−1,000,000..1,000,000].# zalandotask
